# Primes

These optimized benchmarks find the list of prime numbers less than ten million and return their count. 

Four flavors of this function in *NodeJS*, *Python*, *Ruby*, and *Swift* are provided. They are originally from the famzah/langs-performance repo (https://github.com/famzah/langs-performance). However, they were modified/simplified to work directly with the OpenWhisk platform.
