"analyse": "Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It ran at the same time as some other programs about school life such as Teachers. My 35 years in the teaching profession lead me to believe that Bromwell Highs satire is much closer to reality than is Teachers. The scramble to survive financially the insightful students who can see right through their pathetic teachers pomp the pettiness of the whole situation all remind me of the schools I knew and their students. When I saw the episode in which a student repeatedly tried to burn down the school I immediately recalled ......... at .......... High. A classic line INSPECTOR Im here to sack one of your teachers. STUDENT Welcome to Bromwell High. I expect that many adults of my age think that Bromwell High is far fetched. What a pity that it isntHomelessness or Houselessness as George Carlin stated has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school work or vote for the matter. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism the war on Iraq pressuring kids to succeed technology the elections inflation or worrying if theyll be next to end up on the streets.But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home the entertainment sets a bathroom pictures on the wall a computer and everything you once treasure to see what its like to be homeless That is Goddard Bolts lesson.Mel Brooks who directs who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival Jeffery Tambor to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries if Bolt succeeds he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings. The bets on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he cant step off the sidewalk. Hes given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after its written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly Lesley Ann Warren an exdancer who got divorce before losing her home and her pals Sailor Howard Morris and Fumes Teddy Wilson who are already used to the streets. Theyre survivors. Bolt isnt. Hes not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where its fight or flight kill or be killed.While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasnt necessary to plot I found Life Stinks to be one of Mel Brooks observant films where prior to being a comedy it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs for the matter to show what its like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they dont know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money.Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others.Brilliant overacting by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. The corn on face is a classic as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The take on lawyers is also superb. After being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently Im a lawyer he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malevolent than usual. The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are alltime classics. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds. This movie gets better each time I see it which is quite often.This is easily the most underrated film inn the Brooks cannon. Sure its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness unlike say how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS. Many of the jokes fall flat. But still this film is very lovable in a way many comedies are not and to pull that off in a story about some of the most traditionally reviled members of society is truly impressive. Its not The Fisher King but its not crap either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have cast someone else in the lead I love Mel as a Director and Writer not so much as a lead.This is not the typical Mel Brooks film. It was much less slapstick than most of his movies and actually had a plot that was followable. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie she is such a fantastic underrated actress. There were some moments that could have been fleshed out a bit more and some scenes that could probably have been cut to make the room to do so but all in all this is worth the price to rent and see it. The acting was good overall Brooks himself did a good job without his characteristic speaking to directly to the audience. Again Warren was the best actor in the movie but Fume and Sailor both played their parts well.This isnt the comedic Robin Williams nor is it the quirkyinsane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame. This is a hybrid of the classic drama without overdramatization mixed with Robins new love of the thriller. But this isnt a thriller per se. This is more a mysterysuspense vehicle through which Williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper.Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report until Williams character gets close to achieving his goal.I must say that I was highly entertained though this movie fails to teach guide inspect or amuse. It felt more like I was watching a guy Williams as he was actually performing the actions from a third person perspective. In other words it felt real and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story.All in all its worth a watch though its definitely not FridaySaturday night fare.It rates a 7.710 from...the Fiend .Yes its an art... to successfully make a slow paced thriller.The story unfolds in nice volumes while you dont even notice it happening.Fine performance by Robin Williams. The sexuality angles in the film can seem unnecessary and can probably affect how much you enjoy the film. However the core plot is very engaging. The movie doesnt rush onto you and still grips you enough to keep you wondering. The direction is good. Use of lights to achieve desired affects of suspense and unexpectedness is good.Very nice 1 time watch if you are looking to lay back and hear a thrilling short storyIn this critically acclaimed psychological thriller based on true events Gabriel Robin Williams a celebrated writer and latenight talk show host becomes captivated by the harrowing story of a young listener and his adoptive mother Toni Collette. When troubling questions arise about this boys story however Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret according to films official synopsis.You really should STOP reading these comments and watch the film NOW...The How did he lose his leg ending with Ms. Collette planning her new life should be chopped off and sent to deleted scenes land. Its overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly her blindness could be in question  but a revelation could have be made certain in either the highway or video tape scenes. The film would benefit from a reediting  how about a directors cut Williams and Bobby Cannavale as Jess dont seem initially believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization and not a gay impersonation. Sandra Oh as Anna Joe Morton as Ashe and Rory Culkin Pete Logand are all perfect.Best of all Collettes Donna belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be you know like that guy from Psycho. There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women due to a slighter dispersion of roles certainly they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration. She is that good. And director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock  he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.Finally writers Stettner Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere. The Night Listener 12106 Patrick Stettner  Robin Williams Toni Collette Sandra Oh Rory CulkinTHE NIGHT LISTENER 2006 12 Robin Williams Toni Collette Bobby Cannavale Rory Culkin Joe Morton Sandra Oh John Cullum Lisa Emery Becky Ann Baker. Dir Patrick Stettner Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a standout lowkey performance.What is it about celebrities and fans What is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm In the latest derange fan scenario based on true events no less Williams stars as a talkradio personality named Gabriel No one who reads stories hes penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named Pete Logand Culkin who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to No ones editor Ashe Morton who gives it to No one to read for himself. No one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of Pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named Donna Collette giving an excellent performance who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with No one reveals that Pete is dying from AIDS. Naturally No one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess Cannavale whose sudden departure from their New York City apartment has No one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into Donna and Petes backgrounds discovering some truths that he didnt anticipate.Written by Armistead Maupin who cowrote the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the films novice director Stettner and based on a true story about a fans hoax found out has some Hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned potboiler does. It helps that Williams gives a standout lowkey performance as the conflicted goodhearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him the one thing that has escaped his own reality and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.However the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by Stettner it pays to listen to your own inner voice be careful of what you hope for.You know Robin Williams God bless him is constantly shooting himself in the foot lately with all these dumb comedies he has done this decade with perhaps the exception of Death To Smoochy which bombed when it came out but is now a cult classic. The dramas he has made lately have been fantastic especially Insomnia and One Hour Photo. The Night Listener despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release is among his best work period.This is a very chilling story even though it doesnt include a serial killer or anyone that physically dangerous for that matter. The concept of the film is based on an actual case of fraud that still has yet to be officially confirmed. In high school I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson who suffered horrific abuse and eventually contracted AIDS as a result. I was moved by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie the confused feelings that Robin Williams so brilliantly portrayed resurfaced in my mind.Toni Collette probably gives her best dramatic performance too as the ultimately sociopathic caretaker. Her role was a far cry from those she had in movies like Little Miss Sunshine. There were even times she looked into the camera where I thought she was staring right at me. It takes a good actress to play that sort of role and its this understated yet well reviewed role that makes Toni Collette probably one of the best actresses of this generation not to have even been nominated for an Academy Award as of 2008. Its incredible that there is at least one woman in this world who is like this and its scary too.This is a good dark film that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be unsettled though because this movie leaves you with a strange feeling at the end.When I first read Armistead Maupins story I was taken in by the human drama displayed by Gabriel No one and those he cares about and loves. That being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the gloss of Hollywood...Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded With just the right amount of restraint Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his personnel lifeJess and the world around himDonna.As we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps Gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward.Its to bad that most people will avoid this film. I only say that because the average American will probably think Robin Williams in a serious role That didnt work before PLEASE GIVE THIS MOVIE A CHANCE Robin Williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art.Oh and before I forget I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals every scene he is in. He has the 1940s leading man looks and screen presence. Its this hacks opinion he could carry his own movie right nowSI liked the film. Some of the action scenes were very interesting tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene which had a semi truck in it. A very tense action scene that seemed well done.Some of the transitional scenes were filmed in interesting ways such as time lapse photography unusual colors or interesting angles. Also the film is funny is several parts. I also liked how the evil guy was portrayed too. Id give the film an 8 out of 10.There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times. Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis have kept psychologists counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades. Occasionally some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence. That is the premise of the film entitled  The Night Listner. It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon Robin Williams who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles. Perhaps its because his show is losing its authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess Bobby Cannavale and his and best friend Joe Morton he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation. It is here a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help. Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter Rory Culkin. In reading the boys harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents Noon is captivated and wants to help. However things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself enwrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop this might be comical. Instead this may prove to be one of Williams more serious performances. I enjoyed The Night Listener very much. Its one of the better movies of the summer.Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact the entire cast was very good. All played just the right notes for their characters  not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is great as the Mom and never goes over the top. Everyone is very believable.Its a short movie just under an hour and a half. I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie.The director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well.Do not be sucker punched by the previews and ads. It is not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener because you want to see a good story told well. If you go expecting Hitchcock you will be disappointed.My only complaint with the movie was the ending. The director could have left a little more to the audiences imagination but this is a minor quibble.The Night Listener is probably not one of Williams best roles but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat odd but very different movie. I can guarantee you that you have never seen this kind of movie before. Some people maybe wont like the slow pacing of this movie but I think its the great plus of the movie. It is definitely one of the top movies that have come out the year 2006. It has a intriguing performance in a movie with a great content dramatic feeling. This is no americanized movie. Neither is it a predictable movie. You just feel that it is a movie that has secrets which you have a hard time to determine what the outcome of it may be. This is no excellent movie that has everything but hell its a damn good and very original movie.Like one of the previous commenters said this had the foundations of a great movie but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste because Collettes performance was eerie and Williams was believable. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I dont think it was bad editing or needed another director it could have just been the film. It came across as a Canadian movie something like the first few seasons of XFiles. Not cheap just hokey. Also it needed a little more suspense. Something that makes you jump off your seat. The movie reached that moment then faded away kind of like a false climax. I can see how being too suspenseful would have taken away from the reality of the story but I thought that part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie needs to have a Directors cut that tries to fix these problems.The Night Listener held my attention with Robin Williams shining as a New York City radio host who becomes enamored with his friendship with a 14 year old boy Rory Culkin who is very ill. Williams has never met the boy in person as they have only been in contact by talking on the telephone. However Williams exboyfriend nice job from Bobby Cannavale raises doubt about the boy which prompts Williams to arrange a meeting with him in person. What follows makes a permanent impact on Williams in a way he does not expect. I will leave it at that. Toni Collette also stars.I enjoyed this film with Toni Collette giving a memorable portrayal of Culkins adoptive mother. Sandra Oh also starred as Williams friend. The Night Listener is inspired by actual events and it has a somber almost creepy silence throughout. At times it is predictable no thanks to some of the reviews I read before seeing the movie and just due to logic but I liked it anyway. I enjoy Williams in roles like this more so than his comedic characters so that was an added bonus for me. Recommended. 810Popular radio storyteller Gabriel No oneRobin Williamsscraggy and speaking in hushedhypnotic tones becomes acquainted and friends with a fourteenyearold boy from Wisconsin named Pete LogandRory Culkinwho has written a book detailing sexual abuse from his parents.

Thats good in that it keeps the action and storyline lean and clear. Its bad in that it leaves various holes in the plot and doesnt sewup any of the plot openings or backstory. Id rather not go into any great detail except to say thatif you are not familiar with Mr.Maupins works or his personal storyyou feel a little bit out of the loop here. Stillthe performances by Williams I wouldve loved to heard more of his narrationpersonallyColletteCannavaleCulkin and much of the supporting castthe Waitress at the restaurant Colletes Donna frequents does a great job with what small part she hasare topnotch and the mood established herenamelythe chillylonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New Yorkgive a terrific framing for this story. It may have ends that dont tie together particularly wellbut its still a compelling enough story to stick with.If there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing. The premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about. However there is not much tension and Williams mild mannered portrayal doesnt do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy.Collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production felt rushed and holes are apparent. It certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better.One thing is certain Taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort.I absolutely LOVED this film I do not at all relate to all the other comments I have read about it. I was COMPLETELY enthralled through every second I found the story gripping the acting intense and the direction spoton. I would literally jump every time the phone would ring close to the end of the movie. Even though there was nothing scary about the story itself I was soundly on edge through the whole movie  and for the rest of my evening. I found that there were so many perfect choices made...the casting the script the little bits of humor sprinkled in it. There were so many points where the film couldve gone for the cheap thrill but it never did and that for me put this movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers that have come out lately...and for the last number of years.This Night Listener is better than people are generally saying. It has weaknesses and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis no doubt but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. The whole thing feels like one of those fireside this happened to a friend of a friend of mine ghost stories. One big complaint about the movie is the pacing but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility and real life just sort of plods alongno So there are no flashy endings or earthshattering revelations no showdown scenes. Thank Heaven. You have to get into the zone when watching this movie forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a conventionallygood movie. Williams isnt terrific but he easily meets the needs of the story plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic No One as he is the Everyman the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collettes performance should be nominated for an Oscar even if she maybe shouldnt win it. Give it a shot. For quality and content alone The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.When it comes to movies I can be pretty picky and Ill complain about anything and everything that is done wrong. While every movie has its flaws The Night Listener had an exceptionally low count.If you read the last review it was hard since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done. Unfortunately if you read more than 3 lines into that same review you discovered the posters reason for disdain heshe does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack...apparently.So despite the fact that I have never written a review before I thought this movie deserved one based on its merits not the sexual orientation of its director. Lets go over a quick checklist first 1. Great plot Absolutely. I wont give a shred of it away but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials. This is a thriller not a horror and it should be approached as such. The story really will amaze you even more so because its true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events.2. Wonderful Acting Oh Yes. Robin Williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy typecast and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago. He once again achieves high form in his role in The Night Listener playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case of...well Ill let you see for yourself.3. Excellent direction Certainly. Now unlike the other poster to which I referred I actually know something about direction. Ive been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years. Of course I really dont think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if YOU like the direction but I thought I should simply establish once again that Im basing my opinions here on something both substantial and relevant...for example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team LOL.Patrick Stettners direction was moody and dark and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those sosoughtafter feelings of tension and release rather than the messy fastpaced camerawork and quick cuts were so often subjected to today. Some people can truly show you a story through their camera while others feel as if they have to make the story with the camera. I really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized which is as an eyeball through which we all see.4. Lighting cinematography and editing Great all around. Ive already wrote so much and I could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs so Ill just wrap it up.In short go see this movie. Dont listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it especially if theyre so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 14 of the way through their post. Enjoy the show BenSomewhat funny and wellpaced action thriller that has Jamie Foxx as a hapless fasttalking hoodlum who is chosen by an overly demanding U.S. Treasury Agent David Morse to be released on the streets of New York to find a picky computer thiefhacker Doug Hutchinson who stole fortytwo million dollars from the treasury and left two guards shot dead.Bait marks the sophomore feature for Antoine Fuqua The Replacement Killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesnt top his first movie. What the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flatout excellent.Foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film I began to catch on. Hutchinson is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as John Malkovich and patient as the late Laurence Olivier was in Marathon Man. Morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost.The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four cheapie fright flick clunkers in Mexico. This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry from the bunch. Karloff gives a typically spry and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval an elderly eccentric patriarch who invites several of his petty greedy and backbiting nocount relatives to his creepy rundown castle for the reading of a will. Pretty soon the hateful guests are getting bumped off by lethal lifesized toy people who populate the place. Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of Tintorera infamy portrays the dashing police officer hero and Julissa looks absolutely ravishing as the sole likable female character. The clunky plodding nondirection trite bythenumbers script ugly washedout cinematography ridiculous murder set pieces a gross fat slob gets blasted right in the face by a miniature cannon overwrought string score morbid gloomdoom atmosphere largely lousy acting Karloff notably excepted cheesy mild gore poor dubbing and rousing fiery conclusion all lend this enjoyably awful lemon a certain endearingly cruddy and hence oddly amusing ratty charm. A real campy hoot.This tale based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces The Fall of the House of Usher Dance of Death poem  is actually quite creepy from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old blackandwhite movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example The Cat and the Canary The Old Dark House Night of Terror and so on. Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of lifesize dolls that terrorize the guests. He dies early in the film or does he   and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences. I wont go into too much detail here but it is definitely a mustsee for fans of old dark house mysteries.Watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room.Dan Basinger 810Aro Tolbukhin burnt alive seven people in a Mission in Guatemala in the 70s. Also he declared that he had murdered another 16 people he used to kill pregnant women and then he set them on fire.This movie is a documentary that portraits the personality of Aro through several interviews with people that got to know him and through some scenes played by actors based on real facts.Aro Tolbukhin is a serious work so analytical its not morbid at all. Such a horrifying testimony about how some childhood trauma can turn a man into a monster.My rate 710After seeing several movies of Villaronga I had a pretty clear opinion about him  he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters forgetting about a rhythm of the movie. That is why though having good critics his movies never caught the broad audience attention. In ARo he follows the same line but really improved on the rhythm especially in the end of the movie. Frankly speaking I slept through the first part cause though the first part gives necessary information it is really slow. Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga.Recommended.Theres so many things to fall for in Aro Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino Inside the killers mind that its very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning. Lets just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done. Its made with super 8 black and white shots 35 milimeters color interviews flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin its like a movie made a documental or viceversa which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed The movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in Guatemala worked in a religious mission and then killed some people. An act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced. The movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death. Nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character. The one we are witness of the movie.For the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside Aros mind mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done. Nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them. So the first half is based upon recollecting information later things turn into Aros childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring.I dont mean and dont want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy.This has got to be a unique twists of two genres of ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with the living mummy movie genre. This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. The casts is outstanding including TOM BOSLEY who as far as I know never has been in a horror movie before ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My one complaint I just wish we saw more of the giant mummy but other then that I think they did a great job. The dialog the characters and the story was perfect. The acting was wonderful. This has got to be the best movie to come out of the scifi channel. You heard me the best movie to come out of the scifi channel. I give THE FALLEN ONES 9 OUT OF 10.Without Kirsten Miller this project neednt have been completed. However with the awe inspiring beauty and talent that is Miss Miller I would definitely recommend it. It looked as if the other actors were only playing to her strong performance. Wagners dismal attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing but his few scenes didnt detract from being entertained. Mostly my criticisms are with the writing and plot line the group of talent assembled did a heroic job of salvaging what should have been a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing were impeccable and believable. She plays that fine line between assertive and bossy but never offensive she is in fact the structural engineer she claims to be. I wish I had seen this on the big screen but alas I was fortunate to rent it before it was lost.Sure Titanic was a good movie the first time you see it but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying lovestory and think ooh how romantic. The second time and I am not the only one to think this it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking When is this dn ship going to sink And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film I mean who does he think he is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington He does 1 halfgood movie and wont do a film for less than 20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about in my eyes the worst character of the film. Kate Winslets performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie there are too many lovestories as it is filmmakers shouldnt try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie Out of a possible 100 I give this film a mere 71.When I saw this movie I was stunned by what a great movie it was. This is the only movie I think I would ever give a 10 star rating. I am sure this movie will always be in my top 5.The acting is superb. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I dont think anyone could have a better job than Kate. If it is a rainy day and you cant decide what to rent well this is the one. You will love all the acting special effects and much much more.If you have not seen this movie go rent or buy it now You wont regret it.Why do people bitch about this movie and not about awful movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the greatest movie of the 21st Century.With great actingdirectingeffectsmusic and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by all because one day some one said they didnt like it any more so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie not only being the most heavily Oscar Awarded movie of all time the most money ever made ever and sadly one of the most underrated movies Ive ever seen. Apart from that it is truly the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close to being like all the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything by the masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but none match up to James Camerons Masterpiece TITANIC.Just two comments....SEVEN years apart Hardly evidence of the films relentless pullingpower As has been mentioned the lowbudget telemovie status of 13 GANTRY ROW is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal. Having said that however the thing is not without merit  either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se.True the plot at its most basic is a reworking of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR  only without much horror. More a case of intrigue Gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played Halifax investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the house as the main suspect. The script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard. It just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments.Having picked the DVD up for a mere 3.95 last week at my regular video store I cannot begrudge the expenditure. 10.95 would be an acceptable price for the film. Just dont expect fireworksWhats inexplicable Firstly the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time but gimme a break it got 11 oscars for a reason it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. Its a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. Ive rewatched it on TV and video and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen twice or maybe three times actually. But that might be it the appeal of it. Its a Movie yes capital M there its an Epic its a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavyhanded at times.But the reason Titanic works is that its such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind or give me a visual thrill. This movie isnt exactly dumb but its not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didnt cry when Bambis mom died I dont react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million an emotional rollercoaster that if it were a regular one would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And Im sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it and have a ready supply of cynicism then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt youll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10 No not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It cant be bad. Not possible. 1010.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman spiderman was a fun movie but it was a total 911 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasnt anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but im pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.Previously I wrote that I loved Titanic cried at its ending many times over and Im a guy in his 60s. I also wondered about why this great movie which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings. While 29.0 of all votes gave it a 10 rating 10.7 gave it a 1 rating. These 10.7 of these irrational imdb users in effect pulled the overall rating down to 7.0. In my previous comments I blamed this very unusual voting pattern a sudden surge in 1 ratings with a high 10 rating dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level on only one thing hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me Ive tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people young men mostly who defame him left and right. They absolutely hate the man and they will have no part in giving him any credit in Titanic. To answer one other user I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesnt like the movie that much and gave it a 5 or a 6 etc. Everyone has and is entitled to hisher own taste. But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for Titanic pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of Titanic to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical bombs there are many more but these 5 will prove my point. Heavens Gate 1980 was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing and imdb voters ratings were 23.2 10 ratings and 9.2 1 ratings overall rating of 6.1. Big Top Peewee 1988 got 4.3 10 ratings and 9.9 1 ratings overall rating of 4.5. Cat People 1982 got 6.1 10 ratings and 2.6 1 ratings overall rating of 5.8. Blind Date 1987 got 3.0 10 ratings and 2.8 1 ratings overall rating of 5.3. Jumpin Jack Flash 1986 got 4.4 10 ratings and 3.7 1 ratings overall rating of 5.2. WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH TITANIC ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER  THAN TITANIC AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD. Again Titanic got 10.7 1 ratings Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factorI loved this movie since I was 7 and I saw it on the opening day. It was so touching and beautiful. I strongly recommend seeing for all. Its a movie to watch with your family by far.My MPAA rating PG13 for thematic elements prolonged scenes of disastor nuditysexuality and some language.The movie Titanic makes it much more then just a night to remember. It re writes a tragic history event that will always be talked about and will never been forgotten. Why so criticised I have no idea. Couldwill they ever make a movie like Titanic that is so moving and touching every time you watch it. Could they ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible.The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film boring to watch converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes Im not the Romance type either but that should not bother you because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed Everything to the amazing effects to the music to the sublime acting. The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself TITANIC is shown brilliantly in all classes too looks too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. I guess its not too much to talk about. The plot is simple The acting is brilliant based on a true story Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you havent seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical and a film to idolise for Hollywood. Could it get better No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time dont listen to people see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. dont be surprised if you cry tooI had few problems with this film and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True it is over three hours long but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I dont think it is overrated at all I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner a great actor steals every scene hes in. The story is very rich in detail and is hot on character development obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall I give Titanic an 8.510. Bethany Cox.I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big fast and unsinkable... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.So our two main characters are Jack Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose Kate Winslet. Theyre not annoying too much but watch this and youll find out why they could become annoying  httptinyurl.comojhoyn . The main villain I guess is bad luck fate hand of God no blasphemy intended or just plain Caledon Hockley Billy Zane. Combine all of the above and what do you get Oh yes We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following My personal favorite Mr. Andrews Victor Garberidk he was so nice LovejoyDavid Warner MurdochEwan Stewart Lightoller Jonathan Phillips Captain SmithBernard Hill Molly BrownKathy Bates and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter Brock Lovett Bill Paxton. They add something to the story something good. The action in here is awesome especially in the second half the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic an 86 awesomeTitanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the illfated voyage on the unsinkable ship. WriterDirector James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good onscreen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane Kathy Bates Frances Fisher Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story the action suspense and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for its few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the illfated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.The ship may have sunk but the movie didnt Director James Cameron from The Terminator did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is The Dinner table scene in which Roses family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet THE ONE...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.Jack and Rose have a connection that is MOVIE STUFF but its good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.The movie is long but its fantastic Good story good flow good actors Go see it twice if you want Its worth itTitanic has to be one of my alltime favorite movies. It has its problems what movies dont but still its enjoyable.When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic I suppose my first reaction is wait a minute you dont I know so many people who dont like this movie and Im not saying I dont see why. The love story is too cheesy well yes but isnt it enjoyable and moving All right the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic everyone knows that love like this doesnt actually exist. But this is a movie doesnt everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while The next complaint DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well OK in this movie I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think its unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally if one is going to complain that they dont like this movie because they hate romance or because they hate history or tragic movies then Im sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. Its like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie not because you dislike the genre this IS a good movie.Well deserving of its Oscars in particular Best Cinematography which I find to be the best Ive ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I know some of the writing fails such as the constant screaming of each others names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times but overall its an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea such as it being a love story rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic including memoirs form the day it happened and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper not steel and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 1010 not because I like romance movies but simply because its an outstanding cinematic achievement that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didnt have a solid ten overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe its just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot like the frozen baby or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And lets not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someones imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. Ill never let go Jack. Titanic is a great film down to its very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting excellent cinematography beautiful music and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.Another Aussie masterpiece this delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural and it does very well. It doesnt resort to the big special effects overkill like American flicks it focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney  Co. bring to life. It follows the story of a couple who buy an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went outside and whose husband disappeared in mysterious circumstances a century ago. Strange things begin to happen in the house and John Adam begins to turn into the man who disappeared who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 810For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and sciencefiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters arent given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose Gloria Stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Roses and Jacks story alone no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horners finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem the usual James Cameron problem is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart wont go on from this one.Back in 1997 do I remember that year Clinton bans cloning research the unfortunate death of Princess Diana the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic one of the biggest films of all time a tale about the ship of dreams about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I dont think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans 85 of them being teenage girls I was 12 years old at the time and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong of course I grew up and didnt watch the film since I was 14 a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype Was it really the best movie of all time Was that Leonardos real nose OK I know thats silly to say but I did rewatch the film. Being completely honest here Titanic is a great movie best movie of all time no just depends on your idea of a good movie but Titanic delivered in romance humor disaster emotions and never let us go on this maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful they instead discover a drawing of a young woman reclining nude wearing the Heart of the Ocean dated the day the Titanic sank. 101yearold Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. She and her granddaughter Elizabeth Lizzy Calvert visit Lovett and his skeptical team on his salvage ship. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912 the upperclass 17yearold Rose boards the ship with her fianc Cal Hockley and her mother Ruth DeWitt Bukater both of whom stress the importance of Roses engagement to Cal since the marriage will mean the eradication of the DewittBukater debts while they have the outward appearance of the upperclass Rose and her mother are financially broke. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement to the controlling Cal and the pressure her mother is putting on her to go through with the marriage Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching their bond deepens when they leave a stuffy firstclass formal dinner of the rapportbuilding wealthy for a much livelier gathering of Irish dance music and beer in thirdclass. But after Cals servant informs him of Roses whereabouts Rose is forbidden from seeing Jack again. However after witnessing a woman encouraging her sevenyearold daughter to behave like a proper lady at tea Rose defies him and her mother asking Jack to sketch her nude and wearing only the Heart of the Ocean an engagement present from Cal. After a beautiful moment together in the very first backseat fun time they go to the deck of the ship.They then witness the ships fatal collision with an iceberg. After overhearing the ships lookouts discussing how serious the collision is Rose tells Jack they should warn her mother and Cal. Meanwhile Cal discovers Roses nude drawing and her taunting note in his safe so he frames Jack for stealing the Heart of the Ocean by having Lovejoy plant it in Jacks pocket. Upon learning Cal intends to leave Jack to die below deck Rose runs away from him and her mother to rescue him. Jack and Rose return to the top deck. Cal and Jack though enemies both want Rose safe so they persuade her to board a lifeboat. But after realizing that she cannot leave Jack Rose jumps back on the ship and reunites with Jack in the ships first class staircase. Jack and Rose return to the top deck the lifeboats have gone and the ship finally goes down into the freezing Atlantic taking Jack and Rose down.So does Titanic live up to its hype I still say that this is a great movie to watch I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and everyone was in love with the movie. But it has great acting amazing effects a wellwritten story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it you have to admit this movie didnt get a lot of hype just because of Leos baby face or Kates amazing ability to cry on sight this film is something special. It will always hold a special place in my heart it has too seeing that I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. But all that aside I do recommend this movie its a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.1010James Camerons Titanic is essentially a romantic adventure with visual grandeur and magnificence a timeless tragic love story set against the background of this major historical event...

Ive seen it more times than I care to count and I still become transfixed every time with a feeling which is hard to describe. One for the ages.Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic. The plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however. Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane. Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game. If he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries. The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the Titanic which has recently occurred. One of the survivors of the Titanic Rose DeWitt Bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search. She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic. With this the scene shifts to Southhampton Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding. After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned. Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed. The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie. On April 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted. They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film. The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate. The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed. The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help. The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own. The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship. Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking. Also the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle. Overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship. The core group of Rose Jack Cal and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time. Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown Captain Edward Smith the ship designer Thomas Andrew the White Star Line Representative Bruce Ismay and all of the Titanics officers were real. The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards. He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk. The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol. He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations. In addition Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted. The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss. Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic. Furthermore Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best. The richest man on the ship John Jacob Astor who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water. Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke. All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs. The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912. The rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet. Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do. The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted. Everything of the time was very formal. Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie. Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken. The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise. The director James Cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives. Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night. In addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic. Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored. This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed. However the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed. There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed. As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.Technically the film is very well done. To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie. In addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship. Furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage. This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner. At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic. Like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing. If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for you.I find it so amazing that even after all these years we are STILL talking about this movie Obviously this movie wasnt THAT bad or else people wouldnt even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensly and still do I guess this film isnt for everyone but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is overrated or overhyped...well we only have the moviegoing public to thank for that lol You see its not CRITICSarticle writers that make a film HUGE or a HIT with the general moviegoing public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic everyone was in awe. Lets face it a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched Give this movie a break you guys The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you that this was a gooddecentmovie worth seeing then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once not twice but maybe 3 times and more So I really wouldnt say that this movie was overhyped...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being overhyped. ha Critics didnt even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Camerons gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more Personally I LOVE this film. However this film might not be for everyone. DOnt say that this film sucks just because of romance though THat is the most sexist thing Ive ever heard Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better but lets face it...the REAL star of the movie wasnt Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. Its not thier best work Ive seen much BETTER work from both of them but it wasnt the WORST Ive seen on screen before. Give them a breakI avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an overhyped overblown overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards  even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. It was so great she said. You really felt like you were on the ship. Nonsense I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said you might be right but if she liked the movie that much maybe shell want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested. Well maybe thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. OK I thought Ill give it a look see. I didnt want to like it  and I didnt. I loved it What a great movie.Where to start First  the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost you are there type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads then the rising sense of panic. You dont just watch it you really do feel it. Then  the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack are excellent  Winslets being the superior I thought but both were good. They had their rich girlpoor boy characters down to a perfect t I thought. In my opinion though stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Roses mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then  the details. Im no expert on the sinking of the Titanic but I have a reasonable general knowledge and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive indeed. Then  the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dions performance of My Heart Goes On.Problems. Well the romance was perhaps too contrived in the sense that I just dont accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. I know he was invited the first time but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until hes been there for a while. The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed I thought when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre where I think it would have been so much more impressive.910To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue the budget the this and the that....who wants to hear it IF you missed the point of this beyondbeautiful movie thats your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life and this one stands in its own entity in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money How lame is that It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay cynics time to crawl back under your rock I am done.Every once in a while the conversation will turn to favorite movies. Ill mention Titanic and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And theyre too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall yes even more than Star Wars. And today many people wont even admit they enjoyed it. Folks lets get something straight  you dont look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow flying. Iceberg right ahead The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music which has also been a victim of the films success was a key ingredient. James Horners score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dions pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess I am a Titanic buff. As such I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it  in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because Ive had such an interest in the ship all my life. However I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could Open up your hearts to Titanic and you will not be disappointed.I am not a parent neither am I a male. But I was able to identify with every characters heartaches and pains.This is a movie teenagers should watch. Maybe that way they will start appreciating the value of family again. Im sorry for those that dont understand the value of love family and friendship.It was very interesting to watch Patrick Duffy in a different role than that of Bobby Ewing. And it is great to see a 19 year old Ben Affleck giving his best in a moving and sincere performance. He showed at an early age that he is capable of heartfelt drama. He should be offered more serious roles. Note Hollywoodland... his first serious role in years and he went out and won Best Actor at the Venice Festival in 2006.This movie can be appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe shouldnt be watched by children under 10 because they might get scared that the same may happen to their families but I recommend it to the entire family.I bought this movie on DVD and have watched it with friends many times. Because it portrays the values that are important in life.After a brief prologue showing a masked man stalking and then slashing the throat of an older gentleman on a deserted urban turn of the century Australian street we meet Julie Rebecca Gibney and Peter John Adam as they go out house hunting. They manage to get a loan for a fixerupper on a posh Sydney street but it turns out that physical disrepair is not the only problem with their new home. It just may be haunted.13 Gantry Row combines a memorable if somewhat clichd story with good to average direction by Catherine Millar into a slightly above average shocker.The biggest flaws seem partially due to budget but not wholly excusable to that hurdle. A crucial problem occurs at the beginning of the film. The opening thriller scene features some wonky editing. Freeze frames and series of stills are used to cover up the fact that theres not much action. Suspense should be created from staging not fancy fix it in the mix techniques. There is great atmosphere in the scene from the location the lighting the fog and such but the camera should be slowly following the killer and the victim cutting back and forth from one to the other as we track down the street showing their increasing proximity. The tracking and the cuts need to be slow. The attack needed to be longer clearer and better blocked. As it stands the scene has a strong made for television feel and a low budget one at that.After this scene we move to the present and the flow of the film greatly improves. The story has a lot of similarities to The Amityville Horror 1979 though the budget forces a much subtler approach. Millar and scriptwriter Tony Morphett effectively create a lot of slyly creepy scenarios often dramatic in nature instead of special effectsoriented such as the mysterious man who arrives to take away the old slabs of iron which had been bizarrely affixed to an interior wall.For some horror fans the first section of the film might be a little heavy on realist drama. At least the first half hour of the film is primarily about Julie and Peter trying to arrange financing for the house and then trying to settle in. But Morphett writes fine intelligent dialogue. The material is done well enough that its often as suspenseful as the more traditional thriller aspects that arise laterespecially if youve gone through similar travails while trying to buy your own house.Once they get settled and things begin to get weirder even though the special effects often leave much to be desired the ideas are good. The performances help create tension. There isnt an abundance of death and destruction in the filmtheres more of an abundance of home repair nightmares. But neither menace is really the point.The point is human relationships. There are a number of character arcs that are very interesting. The house exists more as a metaphor and a catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it go sour and possibly destroy it. That its in a posh neighborhood and that the relationship is between two successful yuppies shows that these problems do not only afflict those who can place blame with some external woe such as money or health problems. Peters character evolves from a striving corporate employee with normal workbased friendships to someone with more desperation as he becomes subversive scheming to attain something more liberating and meaningful. At the same time we learn just how shallow those professional friendships can be. Julie goes through an almost literal nervous breakdown but finally finds liberation when she liberates herself from her failing romantic relationship.Although 13 Gantry Row never quite transcends its madefortelevision clunkiness as a TV movie this is a pretty good one with admirable ambitions. Anyone fond of haunted house films psycho films or horrorthrillers with a bit more metaphorical depth should find plenty to enjoy. It certainly isnt worth spending 30 for a DVD that was the price my local PBS station was asking for a copy of the film after they showed it factoring in shipping and handling but its worth a rental and its definitely worth watching for free.Daniell Steels Daddy what a refreshing story. This movie glorified the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is that In these times of Heather has two Mommies or what ever you fill in the blanks it is easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. With the fathers roles being prominent I was hoping this would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing to have it end. Every character was important and did a fabulous job carrying their role. I would have loved to see each character develop over the years. I loved this movie it is one I will defiantly watch every time its on. Good story good acting and I hope this isnt a spoiler but no obtrusive sex or bad language. Yes it touched my heart. Warning get the Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely depicted today in our entertainment be it Television or. Movies. Daniell if your listening You Go Girl give us more.Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. Love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about. One man Daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity. The kids grow upone all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall. ALL the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances. Yes I shed a tear along the way knowing I had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent. This true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents. A must see for those who care about their families.Its heartwarming to see a movie that doesnt bash males. In this one the wifemother leaves her family to get in touch with herself  or pursue her libido. The father stays with and nurtures the kids letting neither his work nor his love life interfere with his love of and responsibility to them.I must admit when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as Steamy Romance I was a little bit skeptical. Steamy In a movie from 1968 I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized it was shot entirely in black  white I knew my erotic hopes were dashed.Boy was I wrong Not only does this film have all of the elements of a steamy romance  the discovery of first love fear of the secret being found out a sudden unexpected end  but at times this movie was downright erotic. You will soon forget that it is shot in black  white. The cinematography deserves every accolade it has received over the years. And the performances from the two stars Essy Persson and Anna Gael are intense and memorable. OK so theyre both in their mid twenties trying to play school girls. Its 1968. Do you really expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to effectively explore a lesbian love story like this Many adult women were still trying to come to grips with their sexuality back then. Anyone looking for real teens here is expecting too much.I think this movie was way ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure yet it still managed to leave a lot to the imagination opting instead to give us poetic descriptions to add to what we were shown.I have no doubt lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who love watching lesbians in action Although it wont be all you expect I dont think youll be too too disappointed.This is a film.. not porn.This is a wonderful film Full of tender moments and memories A beautiful piece of work Excellent For intelligent viewers onlyIf you are a film lover. A romantic. A person who has loved deeply this is your filmIt has a beautiful surreal quality. Fine acting and directing. Watching this film made me remember my first love.Thi is a film for those who want to reflect on life love and the meaning of loss.Highly recommended for all film lovers.It was a serious attempt to show the developing sexuality of two schoolgirls and did not try to exploit its fact Even by todays standards the film is interesting and provocative Therese and Isabelle are both attending the same girls school Therese is energetic intelligent and becomes a mentor for the innocent naive sweet Isabelle She guides her through a number of exotic experiences including a trip through an exclusive brothel into her first lesbian liaison and indirectly into her first heterosexual experience The film does not exploit any sex nor is there an abundance of nudity... The imagery is effective but sometimes the camera lingers too long and the story goes slowly The director Radley Metzger went on to make a number of explicit erotic films under the name of Henry Paris He always has extremely detailed stories good acting and very high standards of cinematography...Artistically however this is perhaps his most complete His later attempts supplied for entertainment whereas Therese and Isabelle was a study into the nature of youthful eroticism...We watched this in my Womens Health Issues class to point out how women are treated inferior to men in many societies and I absolutely loved this movie. I plan on trying to get a copy of it myself to watch. The story is very touching and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and this movie was just what I needed. This is a movie for the whole family despite its rating. This is a movie I will show to my children. The professor of our class meant for the movie to primarily be a too to educate about women but this movie was more than that. It is one of those movies that will forever stick out in my mind and will be a favorite.I was going to bed with my gf last night and while she was brushing her teeth I flipped channels until I came across this Chinese movie called the King of Masks. At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie so I started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and I had to finish it.The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor for being so little. Maybe the fact it was in Chinese so the English was dubbed made it harder for me to tell...but she really seemed to be in character perfectly. I felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten. lol. Even when she brings him another grandson just so he can pass on his art...it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live. lol...whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just backfires.In the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks...which is just so heartwarming after all the mishaps in the movie.Definitely a gem and totally original.ScottI admit to being somewhat jaded about the movie genre of a young child softening the heart of hisher reluctant guardian. Ive seen enough of them  Baby Boom Kolya About a Boy Mostly Martha and to some extent Whale Rider  to expect to be bored by the formula. What held my attention in The King of Masks was the grimness of the setting smalltown China in the 1930s. Extreme poverty was the norm and girl children were considered so worthless to poor parents that they killed them at birth or gave them to whomever would take them on the black market. When Wang discovers his purchased grandson whom hes nicknamed Doggie is a granddaughter he initially casts her out even though shes showed great promise as streetperforming heir. Even after he reluctantly takes her back hes not too upset when shes kidnapped. The film is gritty then showing the lengths to which a young streetsmart girl had to go to survive in that society.The two lead performances are believable and beguiling in their societal context. In a Western society one would expect at least a hint of resentment from Wang at not having achieved more material success. Wang so thoroughly accepts his station as a celebrated artist with low societal status though that I did too. While Doggie exhibits a level of precociousness and cunning that would be suspect in a modern suburban child its completely believable in the context of a kid constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after learning that her previous seven owners have physically and mentally abused her her fierce attachment to Wang makes perfect sense.The peek at smalltown life in a foreign country the naturalness of the two lead actors the surprising plot twists and of course the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very watchable film.This movie is the best film ever. I cant remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me. with a tear in my eye I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie must have Excellent Dialogues Music Acting StoryPlot. A story of friendship courage kindliness and loyalty between a Street performing who famous to The King of Masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar. Little girl liked to be his granddaughter and King of Masks liked a grandson. They were not conventional in real. Every scene they were together was priceless. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was Excellent as The King of Masks. Renying Zhou Doggie looks pretty and played her character very well. Zhigang Zhao as Liang Sao Lang was great. He played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well. If you havet this movie try it once Do watch it.Verhoevens movie was utter and complete garbage. Hes a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed. By his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch.Heinlein would have NEVER supported that trash if hed been alive to see it. It basically steals the name mocks politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some TA so the average idiot American moviegoer doesnt get bored.This anime isnt perfect but its at least mostly accurate as best I can tell.Wang Bianlian is an old street performer who is known as a King of masks for his mastery of Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art shouldnt die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in to Wangs mind. The film is about prejudices male domination state of art values and most importantly warmth.I cant recommend this film enough. The whole film is in loops. Everything has a significance. Its a long story which has been edited so well that the length of the film is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it is an artistic film next five minutes its a sad film next five minutes its a thriller. It just keeps changing its mood like its protagonist changes his face. Last scene on the rope is phenomenal. Story and script is flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both the protagonists are artists you can tell the way they have performed. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for Oscars. That year English patient got the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category Kolya won. Kolya was just OK and about English patient the lesser said the better. Watch it 910.One of the most heartwarming foreign films Ive ever seen.The young girl is an amazing talent. Stellar performances by her Doggie the old man the king of masks and Liang the Living Boddhisatva.SPOILER The deplorable treatment of children especially females is disturbing.Loved the music. The original Chinese dialog heightens the emotional intensity of the performances and the story.This is a MUST SEE  enjoyable family film although not for very young children. Would have rated the DVD release even higher if the soundtrack had been transferred better onto the DVD and the transfer had included the widescreen version.Wow. What a wonderful film. The script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by Minglun WeiI hope he has more stories in him.The acting is sublime. Renying Zhou as Doggie was amazing  very natural talent and Xu Zhu was a delight  very believable as the jaded old traditionalist. The soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming. If only more movies like this were made whether in Hollywood or Hong Kong a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem.The filming is pleasant and the environment is keenly realistic. I liked that it boldly redresses conceptions of the many difficult moral and social morays of the 1930s Chinesemainland countryside as well as more basic human questions  I felt I could get a real sense of the times recreated even in splendid shots of traditional Chinese theatre and in purist depictions of street living. It seemed worthwhile to experience. The interwoven role which Buddhism plays is probably the most truetoform  both in its menial and in its philosophic aspect perhaps the most effective that Ive seen in Chinese film. Casting is great. Images are memorable. Acting is solid enough. Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Set in 1930s China during a time of floods we meet Wang an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang he invites Wang to join their troupe. However we learn that Wangs family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that Wang is childless Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy he would teach his new son Doggie the ancient art of silk masks. Soon Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art. Together Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotion."
